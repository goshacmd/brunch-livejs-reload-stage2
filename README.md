# Brunch + Redux + React + Babel/ES6 <3 live JS reload

This is a modern JS skeleton with React and Redux for [Brunch](http://brunch.io).

It is a demonstration of stage 2 live JS reload (as per (as per https://github.com/brunch/brunch/issues/1097#issuecomment-189620537)) that will be possible with Brunch 2.5.0.

Differs from stage 1 in that it uses babel react transform to wrap components into proxies automatically.
